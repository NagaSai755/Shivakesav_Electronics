# Deployment Fix Summary

## Issue Fixed
The deployment was failing because of a mismatch between where build files were created and where the server expected to find them.

### Root Cause
- Build process created files in `dist/` directory
- Server static file serving function expected files in `server/public/` 
- Nested directory structure (`server/public/public/`) was causing conflicts

### Applied Fixes

1. **Cleaned up nested directory structure**
   - Removed problematic `server/public/public/` nested directories
   - Ensured clean file structure in `server/public/`

2. **Created build fix script** (`scripts/fix-build.sh`)
   - Automatically detects and removes nested public directories
   - Copies files from `dist/` to `server/public/` when needed
   - Can be run after builds to ensure proper structure

### Current Structure
```
server/public/
├── assets/
│   ├── index-CwXXz6Fo.css
│   └── index-Dbw-XrqR.js
├── index.html
└── index.js
```

### Usage
Run the fix script anytime after building:
```bash
./scripts/fix-build.sh
```

The deployment should now work correctly with the proper file structure in place.
